The program can also be found on the [SSC RePEc IDEAS archive](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458074.html).\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n`dynsimpie` is a program to dynamically examine compositional dependent variables, first detailed in Philips, Rutherford, and Whitten (2015a) and used in Philips, Rutherford, and Whitten (2015b). Their modeling strategy uses an error correction model within a seemingly unrelated regression to simulate dynamic changes in each compositional dependent variable in response to a counterfactual \"shock\" to an independent variable during the simulation. Up to seven dependent variables may be modeled. Following the work of Aitchison (1986), the dependent variables are first expressed using a log-ratio transformation. `dynsimpie` then models the first differenced series of each compositional ratios as a function of their lag, as well as the lag and first difference of a vector of independent variables. Expected values are calculated, and, since compositional log ratios are not particularly intuitive, these are then \"un-transformed\" and the predicted average proportion of each dependent variable over time is saved to a dataset, along with associated confidence intervals.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
