Their modeling strategy uses an error correction model within a seemingly unrelated regression to simulate dynamic changes in each compositional dependent variable in response to a counterfactual \"shock\" to an independent variable during the simulation. Following the work of Aitchison (1986), the program first expresses the dependent variables in compositional form using a log-ratio transformation. `dynsimpie` then models the first differenced series of each compositional ratio as a function of their lag, as well as the lag and first difference of a vector of independent variables. Expected values are calculated, and, since compositional log ratios are not particularly intuitive, these are then \"un-transformed\" and the expected (or predicted) average proportion of each dependent variable over time is either graphed and/or saved to a dataset, along with associated confidence intervals.\r\n\r\n### Requirements<a id=\"requirements\"></a>\r\n To use `dynsimpie`, the user must first download and install the Clarify package by King, Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000) (`estsimp` and `setx`).\r\n\r\n### Syntax<a id=\"syntax\"></a>\r\n`dynsimpie indepvars [if] [in] [, options]`\r\n\r\n* `indepvars` is a list of independent variables to be included in the model. Independent variables only need to be specified in levels (i.e. un-lagged and un-differenced). The final list of independent variables will be one less than the total number of desired independent variables, since one always has to be specified in the `shockvar` command (see below).\r\n*`dynsimpie` automatically transforms the dependent variables and independent variables into lags and first differences for estimation in error-correction form. Options on `dynsimpie` allow for the addition of dummy variables to the model as well as the ability to shock more than one independent variable at the same point in time.\r\n\r\n## Required options<a id=\"opt-req\"></a>\r\n* `dvs(varlist)` a list of the compositional dependent variables to be estimated in the model. These must be expressed either as proportions (summing to 1) or as percents (summing to 100). `dynsimpie` will issue an error message if neither of these criteria are met. `dynsimpie` will take the log of the proportion of each category relative to the proportion of an arbitrary \"baseline\" category; for example, if there were J dependent variables in `dvs(varlist)`, `dynsimpie` would create J-1 categories of s_{tj} = ln(y_{tj}/y_{tJ}), where the Jth category is the baseline. The reason for this is detailed in Philips, Rutherford, and Whitten (2016).\r\n* `shockvar(varname)` is the independent variable, not included in `varlist`, that experiences some counterfactual one-period `shock` at `time` t. Since this is within an error correction framework, the shock first affects the first difference of `shockvar` at time t for one period, then will move into the lagged `shockvar` for the rest of the simulation.\r\n* `shock( )` amount to change `shockvar(varname)` by for one period at `time` t.\r\n\r\n## Additional options<a id=\"opt-add\"></a>\r\n* `time( )` is the scenario time at which the variable `shockvar` experiences a one-period `shock`. By default, this is set at time period 10.\r\n* `graph` displays a plot of the simulated output. The predicted proportion of each of the compositional dependent variables is plotted against time, along with the associated confidence intervals.\r\n* `saving(string)` specifies the name of the output file that `dynsimpie` will save the results to. By default, this is \"dynsimpie_results.dta\". This dataset contains a time variable, the midpoints, and upper and lower confidence intervals for each dependent variable. This is commonly used for graphing dynamic simulation results.\r\n* `range( )` gives the length of the scenario to simulate. By default, 20 time periods are simulated. `range` must be greater than the `time` at which the shock occurs.\r\n* `sig( )` specifies the level of confidence associated with the calculation of confidence intervals. If not specified, the default is `sig(95)` for 95% confidence intervals.\r\n* `dummy(varlist)` if specified, the program will include these variables as a vector of dummy variables in the model.\r\n* `dummyset(numlist)` by default, each of the dummy variables in `dummy` will be set to 0 throughout the simulation. To set them to an alternative value, change the numbers in `dummyset`. For instance, if specifying `dummy(dum1 dum2)` and we wanted both dummies set to one, add the option `dummyset(1 1)`.\r\n* `shockvar2(varname)` allows for an additional shock to take place at `time` t. As with `shockvar`, this variable cannot be included in `varlist`.\r\n* `shock2(numlist)` is the amount to shock `shockvar2( )` by.\r\n* `shockvar3(varname)` allows for an additional shock to take place at `time` t. As with `shockvar`, this variable cannot be included in `varlist`. \r\n* `shock3(numlist)` is the amount to shock `shockvar3( )` by.\r\n* `notable` by default, a table of the estimates is shown. This option suppresses the automatic generation of the SUR results.\r\n* `nosave` by default, `dynsimpie` will save the results as either \"dynsimpie_results.dta\" or a user-specified name. This option suppresses this output.\r\n* `pv` by default, expected values are produced through Clarify. These average out fundamental variability, keeping only estimation uncertainty. Users wishing to analyze both fundamental and estimation uncertainty can do so by generating predicted values with the option `pv`.\r\n\r\n### Reference<a id=\"reference\"></a>\r\nIf you use `dynsimpie`, please cite us:\r\n\r\nPhilips, Andrew Q., Amanda Rutherford, and Guy D.
